### Accuracy achieved : 58.88% ( on 1000 iterations )
### improved accuracy : 64.11% ( with 2000 iterations )
### updated accuracy : 78.88% ( with 5000 iterations and applied regex for test predictions )
#### [ NOTE : Running the training everytime gives variable accuracy with (+-)1 variation in the score]

### Note : Increasing the iterations is no more reflecting in positive accuracy score, the model seems to be overfitting.

## CUSTOM MODEL'S ACCURACY : 95.14% (without data augmentation)
### it achieved 92% with data augmentation
