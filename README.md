### Accuracy achieved : 58.88% ( on 1000 iterations )
### improved accuracy : 64.11% ( with 2000 iterations )
### updated accuracy : 77.76% ( with 5000 iterations and applied regex for test predictions )

### Note : Increasing the iterations is no more reflecting in positive accuracy score, the model seems to be overfitting.
